## 💡 Personal Reflection

This course has deepened my understanding of rendering in web apps — especially the power of **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **Universal Rendering**.  
I’ve learned how Nuxt automates much of the complexity behind Vue setups while keeping control and flexibility in my hands.  

> _“Nuxt isn’t just a framework — it’s a structured approach to building better Vue apps.”_ ✨
